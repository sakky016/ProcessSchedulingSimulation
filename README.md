# ProcessSchedulingSimulation
This program simulates the Process Scheduling. First a scheduler has to be created. Following are  supported: (1) FCFS (First-come First-served) (2) Priority Scheduling (3) SJF (Shortest Job First) (4) Round Robin (5) Multi-level feedback queue  This has been implemented by inheriting from the ProcessScheduler class. Depending on the name of the algorithm, derived class for that particular scheduler is created.  Jobs with an ID and a random priority are continuously created by an RNG (Random Number Generator). The job creator is a separate thread. This is done so as to simulate scenarios where pre-emption is required.  The scheduler is then started with ProcessJobs() API. it will keep on processing the jobs present in the pending job pool list.
